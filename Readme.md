# Poke memory game

---

- Pok√©mon-themed card game designed to test your memory. The challenge is to click on each displayed card only once per round.
- Each successful click earns a point, after which the cards are shuffled.
- When you successfully click on all the cards in a round, you advance to the next round, which introduces a new random card set and adds two new cards to increase the difficulty.
